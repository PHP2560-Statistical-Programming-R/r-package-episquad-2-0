Using the formuls we learned in the Intermediate Epi class: make a package "episquad" for the basic calculations in epidemiology

Assigned work:
Team member 1: Make functions for cumulative incidence/risk, risk ratio (crude and adjusted), risk difference, PAR

Team member 2: Make functions for incidence rate, rate ratio (crude and adjusted), rate difference, PAR%

Team member 3: Make functions for prevalence, odds ratio (crude and adjusted), AR, AR%

If time permits, we can work on age-adjustment (direct and indirect), plotting a DAG, making graphs for RR, rate ratio, OR etc
