# Outline of the package:

The package "episquad" will have functions for the most common caclulations done in epidemiology.

Assigned work:
- Team member 1: Will make functions for cumulative incidence/risk, risk ratio (crude and adjusted), risk difference, PAR and relevant confidence intervals
- Team member 2: Will make functions for incidence rate, rate ratio (crude and adjusted), rate difference, PAR% and relevant confidence intervals
- Team member 3: Will make functions for prevalence, odds ratio (crude and adjusted), AR, AR% and relevant confidence intervals

Input data can be either in a vector format or in a 2X2 table structure.

If time permits, we can work on age-adjustment (direct and indirect), plotting a DAG, making graphs for RR, rate ratio, OR etc
