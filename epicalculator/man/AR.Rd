\title{
Attributable Risk and Percent Attributable Risk
}
\description{
Calculates the attributable risk (risk difference) and the percent attributable risk with confidence intervals. The variance is calculated based on Greenwoodâ€™s formula. The default confidence interval setting is at 95 percent but can be altered as needed.
}
\usage{
AR (table, ci=95)

ARpercent(table, ci=95)
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{table}{requires the table function which creates a matrix where 'a'
represents the number of exposed and diseased, 'b' represents the number of non-exposed but diseased, 'c' represents the number of exposed but not diseased, and 'd' represents the number of non-exposed and not diseased. The table function also calulates row and column totals The table function will not accept a value less than  0.
}
  \item{ci}{
abbreviation for confidence interval. It should be a number between 1 to 100. The default setting is 95. The confidence interval will not accept a value of 0.
}

# creates a matrix table from a vector
table1<- tablex(23,45,60,789)

# using the table created above, calculates the population attributable risk
AR(table1, ci= 75)

# using the table created above, calculates the population attributable risk percent
