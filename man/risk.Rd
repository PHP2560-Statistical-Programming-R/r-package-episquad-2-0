\title{
Risk Calculation
}
\description{
This function takes a vector of data and calculates risk ratio or risk difference along with confidence interval and result of hypothesis testing for crude and stratified data. Data will be weighted using Mantel‚ÄêHaenszel weights for risk ratio and Inverse variance weights for risk difference.
}
\usage{
risk (data, measure = c("RR", "RD"), ci = 95, estimate = c("crude", "summary"))
}
%- maybe also 'usage' for other objects documented here.
\arguments{
  \item{data}{
a vector of crude or stratified data
}
\item{measure}{
the measure to be used. Measures could be RR (risk ratio) or RD (risk difference)
}
\item{ci}{
an object which indicates the percentage of confidence interval, default is set to 95
}
\item{estimate}{
a vector indicating crude or summary estimate
}
